# RDF-autocomplete

# Client side autocompletion using RDF data
This project investigates the usefullness and performance of client-side autocompletion using http requests over the web.
The prefix tree used for the autocompletion is located on a remote server.
This server will provide access to the prefix tree in the form of RDF-data files.

Suggestions and corrections can be added to provide links to other nodes of possible intrest in the prefix tree.
This gives the client the freedom to persue whatever kind of link is best suited for his application.

# Performance
Performance will be evaluated with different factors.
Variations in size of the data fragments, form and rebalancing will be taken into account.

Benchmarks will be added upon completion.
